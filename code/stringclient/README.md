# stringclient

To use this client script run it via command line with `python client.py PLACE.RASPBERRYPI.IP.HERE`. Optionally, you can also set the host raspberry pi IP inside the python script and run it without arguments.  
At the start of the script, it will connect to the host.  

In order to send a string to the host, simply enter your string and press enter. If there is any response from the host, it will be displayed in the output of the script.
